Eviction Notice Issued to Residents of Type-1A, 1B and Dhobi Ghat – Vox Populi

The following section of article is based on our conversation with the Dean of Administration (DoAd), Professor Kumar Vaibhav Srivastava

Professor Vaibhav states that the eviction notice is not targeted at any specific group, including the Dhobis, but applies to all residents of the area, which also includes institute staff.

Professor Vaibhav claimed that several Dhobis associated with the institute are already operating from outside the campus. The administration suggests that the Dhobis residing at Dhobi Ghat could follow a similar model.

(In response to Professor Vaibhav’s claim, the Dhobis contended that most of those operating from outside the campus use the institute’s Dhobi Ghat for washing purposes.)

He adds that the institute is ready to assist residents in making alternative arrangements outside the campus, should they request such support. Some residents (not Dhobis) might be getting the House Rent Allowance (HRA) as an alternative.

(When asked, the Dhobis mentioned that no formal written assurances have been provided to them.)

Regarding structural reports and comments mentioned in the eviction notice, Professor Vaibhav directed us to the DOIP, as the former did not have access to the reports.

(When we reached out to the DOIP regarding this matter, we were redirected to the Registrar and the Deputy Director of the institute. Subsequently, we contacted both the parties, but have not received a response yet.)

When asked about the future use of the vacated space, he emphasized that the institute’s priority order is: Students & Faculty > Staff > Other groups (e.g. Dhobis). The utilization of the area will be decided accordingly, based on the pressing requirements of the institute, whether for hostels, labs, or other facilities.
