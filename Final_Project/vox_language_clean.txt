Lost In Translation: Language Barriers at IITK – Vox Populi

15.5% of the respondents have little to no comfort with the Hindi language. The inability to interact fluently in Hindi unfurls another set of issues. A common problem mentioned by the respondents is that the mess workers, maintenance staff, etc., speak only in Hindi. Several also said they have difficulty interacting with new people and participating in campus activities as they are usually conducted in Hindi. Sharah PS, a Malayalam-speaking UG Y22, shares her experience of how she has to take a Hindi-fluent friend with her whenever she has to interact with shopkeepers. Even with some of her friends, it becomes difficult to converse as she can only reply in English. Adding on, she mentions that initially, some people were worse off than her and could have used some help. Another respondent mentions an incident where they went to inquire about a government scheme, and the official asked them to respond only in Hindi. “Even after explaining that we could not, the official told us to learn Hindi, bringing it up multiple times and joking about it.”
